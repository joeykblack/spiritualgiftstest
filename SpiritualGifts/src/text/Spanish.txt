introduction_paragraph_2 = La entrega que usted demuestra depende de cómo usted fue diseñado/a servir a otros “en tiempos como este”. Nuestro Padre nos diseñó a cada uno de manera única, entonces es importante que usted no persiga o desee un regalo/deber que no es relevante a su propósito en la tierra. Por lo tanto, uno o varios regalos de Dios no deberían ser considerados unos mejores que otros, especialmente si no concuerda con la tarea que Dios le asigno a usted.
introduction_paragraph_3 = Este inventario fue diseñado para acomodar los regalos de Dios que se encuentran en las escrituras recién nombradas. El autor entiende que algunos de estos regalos ya no existen y han muerto. Sin embargo, si son mencionados en la escritura, probablemente significa que Dios desea los que entendamos y los utilicemos SI Él lo indica. El autor asigno los regalos de Dios en cuatro categorías que parecen cuadrar juntas en base a como servir al Cuerpo de Cristo.
introduction_paragraph_4 = Esta información está diseñada para complementar su comprensión de sus capacidades, comportamientos, valores y motivaciones. Debería ayudarlo a guiarlo mientras sirve a nuestro Dios Viviente. Ahora, también adopte su individualidad y sea agradecido por lo que Él ha diseñado para su vida.
